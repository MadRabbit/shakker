h1.Welcome to Shakker!

Shakker is a mano-a-mano javascript frameworks performance testing suite

The key difference from the TaskSpeed project is that the tests are clean
and perform a blunt feature-to-feature tests. They are not affected by
any sort of elements selection/finding and other utility operations.

It also calculates the statistic based on the average time differences
between test results for different frameworks.


h1.Firing Up

This application uses the Sinatra ruby-based framework. So you'll need
ruby and the @sinatra@ gem installed. After that just say

<pre><code>./index.rb</code></pre>

in the project root directory and open @http://localhost:4567@ in your
browser.


h2.The Elements Building Test

I know most of people would not build complex structures with such stuff,
but as we test the actual feature, and some people occasionally in small cases
will still do building this way, we do test the actual elements building
and appending in the test.

One one hand it might sound unfair towards jQuery, but on the other jQuery
had the strings with preset id, class and the html content, RightJS on the
other hand is asked to assign those stuff manually.
