h1. Welcome to Shakker!

Shakker is a mano-a-mano javascript frameworks performance testing suite

The key difference from the TaskSpeed project is that the tests are clean
and perform a blunt feature-to-feature tests. They are not affected by
any sort of elements selection/finding and other utility operations.

It also calculates statistic based on average time differences
between test results for different frameworks.


h1. Firing Up

This application uses Sinatra a ruby-based framework. So you'll need
ruby and the @sinatra@ gem installed. After that just say

<pre><code>./index.rb</code></pre>

And open @http://localhost:4567@ in your browser.


h2. The Elements Building Test

I know most of people would not build complex structures with such stuff,
but as we test the actual feature, and some people occasionally in small cases
still will do building this way, we do test the actual elements building
and appending in the test.

On one hand it might sound unfair towards jQuery, but on the other jQuery
had the strings with preset id, class and the html content, RightJS in the
test assigns those stuff manually.
