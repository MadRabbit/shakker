This Time It's Personal!
========================

This is just a small framework for a blunt face to face performance test of 
JavaScript frameworks features.

The key difference from the TaskSpeed project is that the tests are clean
and every of them does exactly what it meant. The results are not affected
by any sort of elements selection/finding procedures and all the processes
cleanly.

And finally it creates more or less consistent results.


The Elements Building Test
==========================

I know most of people would not build complex structures with such stuff,
but as we test the actual feature, and some people occasionally in small cases
will still do building this way, we do test the actual elements building
and appending in the test.
